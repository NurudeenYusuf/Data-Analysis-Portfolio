# Project Report: Employee Survey Analysis
**Analyst:** Nurudeen Yusuf
**Tool Used:** Power BI

## Executive Summary
The organization maintains a generally positive sentiment with an overall **77.29% Agreement rate** across 14,000+ valid responses.

### Question 1: Which survey questions did respondents agree with or disagree with the most?
**Answer:**
The analysis of sentiment by question reveals a distinct contrast between professional clarity and social connection.

* **Highest Agreement (Strength):** Respondents agreed most with **"I know what is expected of me at work."**
    * **Observation:** The blue bar for this question is the longest (**sitting at 92.61%**).
    * This indicates that the organization excels at goal setting and communicating job responsibilities. Employees are not confused about their tasks.

* **Lowest Agreement (Weakness):** Respondents disagreed most with **"I have a best friend at work."**
    * **Observation:** This question has the lowest blue bar (**approx. 52.43%**) and the largest red segment.
    * This suggests a potential lack of social bonding, or a culture that feels "strictly transactional" rather than relational.

### Question 2: Do you see any patterns or trends by department or role?
**Answer:**
Yes, there are clear structural trends, particularly regarding organizational hierarchy.

* **Trend by Role (The "Hierarchy Gap"):** There is a direct correlation between seniority and satisfaction.
    * **Directors** show the highest level of agreement (highest bar).
    * **Managers and Supervisors** sit in the middle.
    * **Staff** show the lowest level of agreement.
    * **Insight:** This "Ivory Tower" effect suggests that leadership’s experience of the company culture is significantly more positive than that of the frontline employees. There suggests a potential disconnect between the decision-makers and the execution team.

* **Trend by Department:**
    * **Top Performers:** The **Communications Office (91.85%)** and **Emergency Management (90.11%)** departments report the highest satisfaction levels.
    * **Areas for Concern:** **Sheriff’s Department (51.48%)** report the lowest relative agreement. This is drastically low and calls for concern. This could be due to their being on the field at all times and not being available for routine enlightenment sessions.

## Conclusion & Recommendations

**Conclusion:**
The organization is functionally strong (employees know what to do) but culturally vulnerable (employees feel socially disconnected). Furthermore, the sentiment gap between Directors and Staff indicates that the "view from the top" does not accurately reflect the day-to-day reality of the frontline workforce. The drastically low agreement rate in the Sheriff's Department may lead to security issues if not properly managed.

**Recommendations:**
As an employer, I would take the following three steps to improve satisfaction:

1.  **Launch a "Culture & Connection" Initiative (Addressing the 'Best Friend' Low Score):** Since social connection is the lowest scoring area, the company should invest in team-building activities, cross-departmental mixers, or "coffee chat" programs. The goal is to move the culture from purely transactional to relational.
2.  **Bridge the Leadership Gap (Addressing the Staff vs. Director Trend):** Implement **Skip-Level Meetings** or Town Halls where Staff can speak directly to Directors. The data shows Staff are less happy than their bosses; leadership needs to "walk the floor" to understand the specific friction points affecting entry-level roles.
3.  **Department-Specific Support:** Conduct a focus group specifically for the **Sheriff's Department** teams to understand why their scores are lower than the Communications team. It could be a sense of neglect or a lack of recognition.

# Project Report: NYC Collision Analysis
**Analyst:** Nurudeen
**Tool Used:** Power BI

## Executive Summary
The analysis of collision data reveals distinct patterns in timing, location, and cause. Accidents are not randomly distributed; they are highly concentrated during weekday afternoon-evening rush hours and on specific high-traffic arterials like the Belt Parkway. The primary driver of these incidents is behavioral (distraction) rather than environmental.

### Question 1: Compare the % of total accidents by month. Do you notice any seasonal patterns?
**Answer:**
The trend line indicates a significant fluctuation in accident frequency in the first quarter of the year.

* **Peak Activity:** There is a noticeable sharp peak in **March**, representing the highest percentage of total accidents for the observed period..
* **Seasonal Shift:** Following the March peak, there is a sharp decline in **April**, after which the trend stabilizes. This suggests that the transition from winter to spring may be a high-risk period, potentially due to changing weather conditions or increased activity levels.

### Question 2: Break down accident frequency by day of week and hour of day. Based on this data, when do accidents occur most frequently?
**Answer:**
The Heatmap reveals a clear "Danger Zone" correlated with the afternoon commute on week days.

* **Most Dangerous Time:** The hours between **2:00 PM (14:00) and 6:00 PM (18:00)** show the highest density of accidents (darkest red cells), with **4:00 PM (16:00)** being the highest.
* **Most Dangerous Day:** **Friday** appears to be the most accident-prone day, specifically around **4:00 PM (16:00)**, where accidents peak at over 2,400 incidents.
* **Pattern:** This confirms a strong "Rush Hour" effect. Mornings (8 AM - 9 AM) show moderate activity, but the afternoon fatigue/volume combination creates a much higher risk environment.

### Question 3: On which particular street were the most accidents reported? What does that represent as a % of all reported accidents?
**Answer:**
A few specific arterials account for a disproportionate number of crashes.

* **Top Location:** **Belt Parkway** is the most dangerous road by a significant margin, with 3,728 accidents reported. [cite_start]It represents 17.3% of the total reported accidents.
* **Comparison:** It has significantly more accidents than the second-highest location, **Broadway**. This identifies the Belt Parkway as a critical infrastructure "hotspot" requiring immediate safety review.

### Question 4: What was the most common contributing factor for the accidents reported in this sample?
**Answer:**
The data overwhelmingly points to driver behavior as the root cause.

* **#1 Cause:** **Driver Inattention/Distraction** is the leading cause of accidents, accounting for nearly **58,308 incidents**.
* **Scale:** This single factor outnumbers the next two causes (**Failure to Yield** and **Following Too Closely**) combined. This indicates that while speeding and aggressive driving are issues, simple distraction is the single biggest threat to safety on NYC roads.

## Conclusion & Recommendations

**Conclusion:**
Public safety in NYC is being compromised primarily by distracted driving during the weekday afternoon rush, specifically on major highways like the Belt Parkway. The consistency of the "Inattention" metric suggests that physical road improvements alone will not solve the problem without behavioral changes.

**Recommendations:**
Based on these findings, I recommend the following targeted interventions:

1.  **Targeted Patrols on Belt Parkway:** Since Belt Parkway is the clear outlier for accident volume, increased traffic enforcement and "High Visibility" patrols should be deployed there, specifically between **2 PM and 6 PM on Fridays**.
2.  **"Eyes on the Road" Campaign:** With "Driver Inattention" causing ~60k accidents, the city should launch a public awareness campaign focused on phone use and distraction. Digital billboards on the Belt Parkway warning of high accident zones could be effective.
3.  **Infrastructure Review for Top 3 Streets:** Conduct a traffic engineering audit on **Belt Parkway**, **Broadway**, and **Atlantic Avenue**. Are the lanes too narrow? Is signage unclear? Engineering fixes here would yield the highest ROI for accident reduction. Bumps can also be introduced.

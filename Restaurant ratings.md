# Project Report: Restaurant Ratings
**Analyst:** Nurudeen Yusuf
**Tool Used:** Power BI

## Executive Summary
The analysis indicates a market heavily dominated by a specific demographic: **single students aged 20–29** with a **medium budget**. While "Mexican" cuisine commands the highest demand by a massive margin, its average rating is only mediocre (1.22/2.0), suggesting a "quantity over quality" saturation. The data reveals that contrary to the budget-conscious demographic, restaurants with **Medium pricing**, **Alcohol service**, and **Smoking sections** actually achieve higher customer satisfaction scores.

### Question 1: What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on ratings?
**Answer:**
* **Top Performers:** The leaderboard is topped by **Emilianos**, **Michiko Restaurant**, and **Restaurant Las Mananitas**, which all achieved near-perfect average ratings (approx 2.0).
* **Service Features Impact:** There is a clear correlation between amenities and satisfaction.
    * **Alcohol:** Restaurants with a **"Full Bar"** or **"Wine & Beer"** consistently outscore those with "None".
    * **Smoking:** Venues that allow smoking (especially "Bar Only" or "Smoking Section") have higher average ratings than those that do not.
    * **Price:** Surprisingly, **High** and **Medium** price restaurants have higher average ratings than **Low** price options, despite the user base being students. This suggests that students are willing to pay more for a better experience.

### Question 2: What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample?
**Answer:**
Yes, there is a severe selection bias.
* **Age & Occupation:** The sample is overwhelmingly skewed toward the **20–29 Age Group** and the **Student** occupation.
* **Marital Status:** **Single** respondents make up **89.86%** of the data.
* **Budget:** The majority of consumers (**65.94%**) operate on a **Medium** budget, with Low budget being the second largest group.
* **Implication:** This dataset does not represent the general population (families, retirees, etc.). It represents the "University Lifestyle." Any business decision based on this data must cater specifically to young, single students.

### Question 3: Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?
**Answer:**
* **The "Mexican" Paradox:**
    * **Demand:** Mexican cuisine is the undisputed king of demand, with a **Cuisine Popularity score of 331**. The next closest cuisines (American, Cafeteria) have popularity scores of 11 or lower.
    * **The Gap:** Despite this massive demand, the **Average Food Rating for Mexican is only 1.22**. This indicates that while everyone eats it, few are "Highly Satisfied" with the current options. The market is flooded but mediocre.
* **Niche Opportunities:** **American** cuisine shows decent popularity (11) but a low rating (1.10), suggesting another area where quality is lacking.

### Question 4: If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?
**Answer:**
Based on the Key Influencers analysis and demographic trends, the ideal investment is a Social Hangout for Students.
* **Pricing Strategy:** **Medium**.
    * **Evidence:** The Key Influencers visual explicitly states that **"When Price is Medium, the likelihood of being High Rated increases by 1.16x."**. This is the sweet spot between student affordability and perceived quality.
* **Amenities:** Must include **Alcohol Service** (Full Bar preferred) and a designated **Smoking Section**. The data shows these features correlate with higher satisfaction.
* **Cuisine:** **High-Quality Mexican**.
    * **Strategy:** Since 331 consumers want Mexican food but are currently giving it a 1.22 rating, entering the market with a **premium/better-tasting** Mexican option would capture this massive existing audience.

## Conclusion & Recommendations

**Conclusion:**
The market is defined by a homogeneous group of young, single students who prefer medium-budget dining. Currently, the most consumed food (Mexican) is receiving average ratings, creating an opening for a "Quality Leader" in that space.

**Recommendations:**
1.  **Open a "Premium-Casual" Mexican Restaurant:** Target the massive existing demand for Mexican food but differentiate with higher food quality to beat the current 1.22 average rating.
2.  **Adopt the "Social Hub" Model:** Since the demographic is 90% single and 20-29 years old, the venue should focus on social atmosphere. Incorporate a **Full Bar** and **Smoking Area**, as these features are statistically proven to boost ratings in this dataset.
3.  **Pricing Positioning:** Avoid "Low" pricing (which correlates with lower ratings) and "High" pricing (which excludes the student budget). Stick strictly to the **Medium** price point to maximize the "High Rating" probability (1.16x lift).
